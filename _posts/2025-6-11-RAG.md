You must have heard about this term booming all across the feilds of AI.

Well does the hype for it lives upto the expectations of its impact? Yess!! ofcourse, it does, and we will deep dive into its core functionality by familirizing with each of its componenets piece by piece.

Before that we will look into how an llm generates an output without RAG to understand the need for it.

Meanwhile on June 14, 2025, South Africa just chased down 211 at Lordâ€™s to get their first icc cup ever.

You can see the problem here, without RAG, the LLM is not able to give the information that is up to date, to fix these sort of issues we use RAG.
