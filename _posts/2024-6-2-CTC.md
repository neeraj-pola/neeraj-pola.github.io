title: Contextual Temporal Classification

***

Dare I say, ctc is as crucial as transformers in language models.

Ctc can be used for cursive handwriting, sequence based problems, digital signal processing especially in automatic speech recognition(ASR).

So, what is the base of ctc?

They are Recurrent neural network (RNN)

We will try looking for __ASR__, that is speech to text and what is speech made of? 

Yes audio...

Audio can be in form of wave or digital signal

This raw audio is directly given as an input to the rnn.


But it would be impractical for rnn to take whole audio at once, so the audio is split into frames

>__Did you know__: although digital signals look continuous, they are not! They are infact discrete in both time and amplitude


>![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CTC/discrete_signals.gif)

These frames are given as inputs to the rnn, one by one...

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CTC/frames_to_rnn.gif)

What are these outputs (y1,y2,y3)..?

These outputs are classified labels...

Now what are this?

Let us take an example,
Sentence = **_‘I am Batman’_**

Classification labels are the unique characters either in a sentence or a corpus,so for the senenece above, the labels are __I,a,m,B,t,n__

Let us see what are the classification labels from y1

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CTC/random_outputs_from_rnn.gif)

The label values are random consisting both positive and negative values.

Now, what is the problem with the above values…?
There is no parameter or heuristic to compare the probable output out of all the labels from y1...

There is a saviour for us in terms of **_SOFTMAX_**

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CTC/softmax.png)

It is just a function that converts all labelled values in the range 0 to 1.

How does this help now?In a way of fact, they can be used as probability of occurrence of a character. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CTC/rnn_outputs_after_softmax.png)

Similarly, as for y1 in t1, every output from rnn is stored from various times in some backend.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CTC/all_rnn_outputs.png)

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CTC/probability_legend.png)

Okay, now we have got the arsenals in our hand, the nodes(probabilities) for all labels in different time stamps.

What is our goal? 

Align the sounds in text format, for simplicity we are using characters which are needed to be aligned.Though it is as easy as it sounds, there are many obstacles to reach the fortress.
Let us face the obstacles one by one.

Firstly, let us just arrange the nodes in an order and see how it looks, for simplicity we will try to align just for batman
