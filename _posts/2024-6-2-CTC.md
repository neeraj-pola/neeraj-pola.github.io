Dare I say, ctc is as crucial as transformers in language models.

Ctc can be used for cursive handwriting, sequence based problems, digital signal processing especially in automatic speech recognition(ASR).

So, what is the base of ctc?

They are Recurrent neural network (RNN)

We will try looking for __ASR__, that is speech to text and what is speech made of? 

Yes audio...

Audio can be in form of wave or digital signal

This raw audio is directly given as an input to the rnn.


But it would be impractical for rnn to take whole audio at once, so the audio is split into frames 


>__Did you know__: although digital signals look continuous, they are not! They are infact discrete in both time and amplitude
