# Contextual Temporal Classification

Dare I say, ctc is as crucial as transformers in language models.
Ctc can be used for cursive handwriting, sequence based problems, digital signal processing especially in automatic speech recognition(ASR).
So, what is the base of ctc?
They are Recurrent neural network (RNN)
* Note: two outputs from different time steps are not related in RNN*
We try looking for asr, that is speech to text
What is speech made of? audio.. that is a wave or a signal

The raw audio is directly given as an input to the rnn.
But it would be impractical for rnn to take whole audio at once, so the audio is split into frames
