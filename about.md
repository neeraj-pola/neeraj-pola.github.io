Hey there! My name is Neeraj Kumar Pola, and I'm excited to share my learnings here. 

**My interests**: I like everything about Artificial intelligence, especially in sub-fields like Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer vision. 

Although my journey to learn them was not easy because of all the math and equations involved, it took my sweet time to grasp the intuition behind them. Thus, my motto is to ease the time for future learners through visualizations.

Any suggestions on the work is appreciated.
